# svSocket To Do list

-   Rework the mechanism to add history item to R from within Komodo.

-   Easy redefinition of `options(width = ...)` to adjust width of output to the GUI client R console.

-   Make use of a config file for the server + `par_socket_server()` to change (some!) parameters of the server.

-   Translation of all messages in the package.

-   Delete `socket_client_xxxx` on disconnection + make sure they are all deleted on server stopping and on package detaching (in `.Last.lib()`).

-   `source_part()` function sourcing only from line X to line Y in a file!

-   Send a command to the regular command line.

-   Silent mode (interesting with `echo = TRUE`).

-   Correct little glitches with multiline mode and empty lines.

-   A mode that flags various parts of output.

-   Unattended messages should be printed above command line.

-   Allow for remote connection + security? Use a tcl list:

    \% set xxxx_allow [list] % llength \$xxxx_allow % lappend xxxx_allow "194.127.34.1" % lindex \$xxxx_allow 0 hiking % lindex \$user_preferences 1 biking % lindex \$user_preferences 2 whale watching % lindex \$user_preferences 3 % lindex \$user_preferences 5 % \# Before we test: % lappend xxxx_allow "127.0.0.1" if { [lsearch -exact \$xxxx_allow \$addr] != -1 } { \# the address is the allowed list }

-   Implement a way to interrupt from the remote console + correct `<<<esc>>>`.

-   Manage buffered output with `flush.console()`!

-   Redirect `stdin()` so that `scan()`, etc.

-   For multiline commands, do number them.

-   `<<<E>>>` with addition of the command in the R command history.

-   Check and solve possible clash when several clients submit commands at the same time.

## Differences between CLI and processSocket()

Tested with R 2.6.1 and testCLIcmd.r v. 1.0-0

-   When successive commands are issued and the last one is incomplete like:

    > search(); log(

`process_socket_server()` waits for a complete last command before processing everything while other consoles process all the commands and then wait for last one to be completed (should be considered as a feature).

-   Same problem with multiple instructions send at once when there is an error: the first few correct instructions before the error should be evaluated, while they are not with `process_socket_server()` (considered as a feature). Compare this:

    > search(); log)

-   For long calculations, `process_socket_server()` acts as a buffered console (like RGui) except that it does not understand (yet) `flush.console()`!

-   There are sometimes cosmetic differences in the way warnings are printed (essentially, truncation of call argument). For instance:

    > options(warn = 0) (function() {warning("Warn!"); 1:3})()

-   There are slight differences in the way the error message is presented when incorrect code is processed. Moreover, R.app (Macintosh) does not print a descriptive error message, but only "syntax error". This is an old behaviour that remains only in R.app (among all tested consoles).

-   R.app (Macintosh) always print prompts at the beginning of a line. So, `cat("text")` does not produce exactly the same result as in many other consoles including with `process_socket_server()` (should be considered wrong in R.app!).

-   R.app (Macintosh) incorrectly prints a continuation prompt after:

    > options(warn = 2) (function() {warning("Warn!"); 1:3})()

-   R.app (Macintosh) does not interpret `\\a` and `\\b` on the contrary to most other consoles. With `process_socket_server()`, it is the client that must decide how to interpret special characters. Most important ones are: `\\a` =\> sound a bip and print nothing, `\\b` = backspace, erase previous character, except if at the beginning of a line, `\\t` = tabulation (4 spaces), `\\n` = newline, `\\r` = same as `\\n` (but not interpreted on RGui), `\\r\n` = same as `\\n`, `\\r\\r` and `\\n\\r` are equivalent to `\\n\\n` (for portability) from one platform to the other. `\\f` and `\\v` are interpreted as `\\n` (but not on RGui under Windows), `\\u` and `\\x` are also recognized but interpreted differently from one to the other console, as well as the other exotic escape sequences. It is better to ignore them, or to print a question mark instead.

-   Regarding internationalization of error messages, there are two differences between messages at the CLI and issued by `process_socket_server()`.

-   Warning message(s): is not translated at CLI bu it is translated by `process_socket_server()` (bug?) in:

    > options(warn = 0) warning("Warn!")

-   On the contrary, `process_socket_server()` fails to translate 'Error in' for most error messages, and I don't understand this bug:

    > cos("a")

-   If you define `options(warning.expression)`, there will be a problem because `process_socket_server()` redefines it also, and thus, at best, you expression is ignored (must fix this!).

-   On the MacOS, there are many mismatches for string translation, both at the command line and using `process_socket_server()`, but they are not same mismatches!
